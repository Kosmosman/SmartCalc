- Fix compilation issues with `Qt >= 6.2.0` (thanks to _miccs_ on thread forum [qt 6.2 patch][path-qt-6.2])

## [2.1.0] - 2022-01-10

Creation of the repository which provides :
- **QCustomPlot** library compliant with _Cmake_ projects (`.pro` file has been replaced by `CMakeLists.txt`)
- Hide _Qt dependencies_, callers no longer needed to add mandatory modules of the library in their own _CMakeLists_ project (like `printsupport` module for example)
- Add a `config.h` file, generated at CMake step, in order to know which version of the library we are using from the caller project (multiple macros are defined, like `QCP_LIB_VERSION` for example).
