# Smart Calculator v1.0
This application extends the standard functionality of the calculator by adding plotting f(x) and variable substitution capabilities in an expression.

To installing the program, use the "**make install**" command (Use a regular terminal for this, the built-in terminal in VScode can generate bugs). 

P.S. You need Cmake with version **3.5** or higher.

Makefile contains all standard targets: **all**, **install**, **uninstall**, **dist**, **dvi**, **test**, **gcov_report**, **clean**.
